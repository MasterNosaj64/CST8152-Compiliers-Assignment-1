#Compiliers - Assignment 1 - CST8152 - Algonquin College - Computer Engineering - Computing Science

-  Implement a buffer data structure in C, focusing on dynamic structures, memory management, and file I/O to understand compiler internals.
-  Create buffers in fixed-size, additive self-incrementing, and multiplicative self-incrementing modes with dynamic allocation.
-  Ensure functions for buffer operations are robust, preventing abrupt termination or crashes due to errors.
-  Test the buffer using a provided harness, ensuring it works under normal conditions and adheres to specifications.
-  Optional: Implement a preprocessor macro for the buffer's full check, allowing selection between macro and function at compile time.
